Mira, a pretty crappy but maybe someday will be kinda usable programming language.

Obviously in early development.

I'm building this partly for fun and partly cause I'm a dreamer.

Early prototype is being built in python because it's easy.

So far the only dependency is pyparsing.

If you want to run the repl, just run repl.py with python3.
